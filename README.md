This project's goal is to make a singleplayer recreation in Godot Engine so that the minigames can be played with improved performance and playablility.

Currently, the project is neither being worked on, neither completely dropped. It is unsure what will come out of this project!

# Mission

The project's goal is the following:

1. Make minigames that don't have any performance issues (after all, the Club Penguin minigames are simple, yet they struggle with performance with Flash and poor design)
2. Make them accurate in FEELING. It would be difficult to emulate their exact behavior but their visuals and gameplay should be nearly indistinguishable
3. Skill transferring: Playing these minigames or the original requires the same skillset, so getting better at one makes you better at the other

# Building

1. Make sure you have downloaded Godot .NET support from the website (versions 4.2.1 is used)

2. Make sure you have .NET 6 installed

3. Clone the code and open the project in Godot Engine, you should be good to go!

# Contributing

Contact the project collaborators if you have interest in programming.

Game testing and bug hunting is always appreciated!
