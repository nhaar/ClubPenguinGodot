This project's goal is to make a singleplayer recreation in Godot Engine so that the minigames can be played with improved performance and playablility.

Currently, the project is neither being worked on, neither completely dropped. It is unsure what will come out of this project!

# Building

1. Make sure you have downloaded Godot .NET support from the website (versions 4.2.1 is used)

2. Make sure you have .NET 6 installed

3. Clone the code and open the project in Godot Engine, you should be good to go!

# Contributing

Contact the project collaborators if you have interest in programming.

Game testing and bug hunting is always appreciated!
